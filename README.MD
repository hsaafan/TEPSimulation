# Tennessee Eastman Process Simulation
The Tennessee Eastman Process is a commonly used benchmark for process control
algorithms. The simulation was originally written in Fortran.

# Project Description
This project is a Python implementation of the Fortran simulation. The main
goals of this simulation are to:
* Implement the simulation in a more commonly used language
* Document the simulation
